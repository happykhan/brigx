# BRIGX

BRIG (Blast Ring Image Generator) is bioinformatics software for visualizing and comparing microbial genomes. It creates circular genome maps, highlighting similarities and differences among genomes using BLAST comparisons. Users can customize visuals, export images, and integrate additional data for in-depth genome analysis.

BRIGX is the web-based version of BRIG. It is a web application that allows users to upload their own data and generate BRIG images. It is a complete rewrite in JavaScript.
